mm3e-animations allows you to execute sequencer and automated animation lookep up based on the descriptor and power effect of the item being clicked on. Building a complete list of animations for an effects based systems like Mutants and Masterminds is basically impossible. 

Check out lateest docs on the Wiki (https://mm3efoundry.notion.site/Descriptor-Animations-for-MM3E-166b3a3d89ed809fbdf5d7d368748ad8)

Effects based systems allow players to define the exact power they want by purchasing a game effect for their character (like damage for instance), applying one or more modifiers (like range and area effect), and then finally a descriptor (like fire, or maybe a thrown hammer). This modulemakes animating powers for this type of system by:
1. Providing a mechanism to invoke an animation based on the descriptor, range type, option area shape, and power effects of an item being clicked
2. Support for automated animations entries and sequencer macros
3. an Autorec file with a set of pre-labelled entries for various descriptor-range-area-effect combinations out of the box!
4. A collection of bespoke sequencer scripts that have been componetized into various descriptor-range-area-effect scripts that can be mixed and matched, Earth, Air, Fire, Radiation, Lightning, Black Venom, to name a few with many more on the way!
5. A custom UI that enables quick mixing and marching of the above seqiencer scripts into customized macros

I'll be updating with more documentation, sequencer scripts, and other functions in real time,  in the meantime hit me up on the green ronin channel over on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546">foundry discord!</a>


**Module Dependencies:**
We use Sequencer for all of our bespoke descriptor animations (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sequencer )
- We have created a large number of descriptor animations using Automated Animations (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/autoanimations)
- Many of our animations rely on JB2A Patreon (https://jb2a.com/)
- Many animations also use Jacks Cartoon Spell Effects (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/animated-spell-effects-cartoon)
- A few animations use Jinkers Animation  (https://www.jinker.org/patreon/)
- We occasionaly rely on  FXMaster (https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster)
